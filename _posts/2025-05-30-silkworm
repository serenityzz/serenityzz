# :woman: Silkworms 
This spring, I raised some silkworms for the very first time. 
I grew up in the Yangtze River Delta, where it's a common practice for people to raise silkworms to produce silk; in spring mulberry plentiful-the only food silkworms eat.  
Still never before in my life have I ever raised any silkworms myself. I avoided it because I don't like insects, especially the soft-bodied kind without a spine. 
Just thinking about them crawling would make me feel uneasy.<br>

The idea to raise silkworms came from my daughter's Nature class at school. One evening during dinner, she said, *"Mum, our Nature teacher will give us silkworms to raise at 
home. Can I bring some back so we can watch how they grow through different stages and eventually become moths?"*<br>
I wanted to say no. But trying to be a supportive mother, I gave a reluctant yet encouraging nod. <br>
*"Sure, if you want to. But you'll have to take responsibility for taking care of them."* <br>

The next day, she came home with them - in a small box she'd folded from a piece of paper. Inside were tiny black specks, barely visible. <br>
*"Where are your silkworms?"* I asked. <br>
*"They're in there."* She replied, pointing to the box.<br>
I looked inside. *"There's nothing here."*<br>
*"See the black dots? They are the eggs. They will hatch in a few days."* <br>
They eggs were so small, like dust. If I hadn't known that, I might have wiped them away. 

Over the course of one week, the black dots turned grey, and then became little black lines about two millimeters long. Each day, they grew noticeablely bigger. 
Each evening after I came home from work, I would spend some time just watching them eat malberry leaves. They were completely absorbed in their task. 
If you leaned in close enough, you could even hear them munching - a sound like soft raindrops falling on leaves during a spring night. <br>
That quiet moment brought me unexpected comfort during a tough time - the company I have been working for had just announced that it would close all of the positions in the city where I live. <br>
As I watch the silkworms eat without a care in the world, I was wondering: how can they be so calm? Is it because eating is the only thing they can do? Or is it because they firmly believe that if they just keep eating, they will grow?<br>
I don't know the answer. <br>
But perhaps, just like them, the only thing I can do is to keep going, and for me, that is to keep writing :pencil:.
