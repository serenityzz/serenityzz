To improve my English, I started listening to podcast during my daily commute about one month ago. I come across new vocabularies from time to time and write them down in my blog to better memorize them.<br> 
This is the first vacabulary log.<br>

### dogfood
- **Meaning:** A slang used in the tech industry. To use your own product or service in real-life situations to test it and show confidence in its quality. <br>
    It comes from the phrase **eating your own dog food**. Someone uses a polished version: **Drink our own champaign**. 
- **Example sentence:** Dogfooding a proudct sufficiently before the release can prevent critical issues.<br>
