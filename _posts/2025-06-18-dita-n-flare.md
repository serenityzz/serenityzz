During an interview for a technical writer, I was asked what tools we use for wrting in my current company. I mentioned that we use MadCap Flare as the authoring and output generation tool. One interviewer asked if it is DITA. Another interviewr explained that MadCap Flare is not DITA. I was not quite sure if MadCap Flare is DITA during the interview, so I conducted some researches about DITA and MadCap Flare. 

## What is DITA?
**DITA**, Darwin Information Type Architecture, is an authoring approach that features modular and reusable content. You write content in small, reusable chunks called topics and use them for dynamic information needs. For example, you write a topic introducing a feature, and this topic can be published in various outputs like online or print, or across differnt channels like user manuals and marketing brochures.
