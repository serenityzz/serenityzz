This topic introduces single-sourcing, its benefits, and how to apply single-sourcing in MadCap Flare.<br>
## Overview
Single-sourcing refers to the practice of creating pieces of content once and reuse them in different outputs or formats. It is commonly used in technical writing where you create content in a central place and use it in various formats such as online helps, PDFs, and printed materials. It reduces redundancy, enhances consistency, and makes content update easier to manage.   
## Use case examples<br>   
When a lot of content is shared, it can be more efficient to single source the content. Here are some use case examples.<br>

- **Example 1**: Product A and Product B follow the same safety guidelines. You create a single safety guide topic and use it in the manuals of both products.
- **Example 2**: You write an introcution for a new product. The docs team includes the product introduction in the user manual and the marketing team uses the same introduction in the product brochures.

## Benefits of single-sourcing    
Single-sourcing provides the following benefits: <br>

- **Efficiency**. For the shared content, you only need to create it once and you can then reuse it often. This eliminates content duplication, saves time, and improves efficiency. <br>
- **Consistency**. When there's a need to update the content, you only need to make the update in a single place and the update is reflected in all places where the content is used. This ensures content consistency across outputs and channels.<br>
- **Scalbility**. When information needs expand, single-sourcing allows easy scaling. For instance, if your product manual used to be published in PDFs only and now you also need to make it available online, with single-sourcing, you can generate the HTML output using the same set of content. <br>

## Single-sourcing in Flare
In previous jobs I used Flare as the authoring and output generation tool. It supports single-sourcing, content reuse, and various outputs. This section provides details on how to single-source content in Flare.<br> 
In Flare you can single source content at the paragraph, topic, and output levels. <br>
### At paragraph level
Use snippets to single source small chunks of reusable content, such as paragraphs, tables, and images. When using snippets, the formating of the content is preserved. For example, if commands A and B share the same set of parameters, you can create a snippet containing a table that describes those parameters. Then you insert the snippet in each respective topic that describes the two commands.   
### At topic level
When larger pieces of content can be shared, you can single source and reuse the content at the topic level. For instance, you create a topic introducing a product and then use this topic in the product's user guide and administration guide. If some sentences or paragraphs in the topic require different content for different guides (such as a feature only available to admins), you can use conditional text in the relevant sentence or paragraph.  
### At output level
When large volumes of content (like most content in a guide) can be shared, you can set up one Flare project and generate various outputs. Typical use cases of this are: <br>
- On-premises and SaaS versions of the same product. 
- A same help guide published online and in PDFs. <br>

To use a single Flare project to generate various outputs, do the following:<br>
1. Set up a TOC for each output.
3. Set up a target for each ouput.
4. For topics that require different content for each output, you can use conditional content or snippets. For details, see [At paragraph level](#at-paragraph-level) and [At topic level](#at-topic-level).
