During an interview for a technical writer position, I was asked what tools we use for content management in my current company. I mentioned that we use MadCap Flare as the authoring and output generating tool and it is an XML-based tool. One interviewer asked if it is DITA. Another interviewr explained that it is not DITA. I was not quite sure if MadCap Flare is DITA during the interview, so I conducted some researches about DITA and MadCap Flare.
