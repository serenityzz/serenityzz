Single-sourcing refers to the practice of creating pieces of content once and reuse them in different outputs or formats. It is commonly used in technical writing where you author content in a central place and use them in various formats such as online helps, PDFs, and printed materials. It reduces redundancy, enhances consistency, and makes content update easier to manage.   
## Use case examples<br>   
When a lot of content is shared, it can be more efficient to use single-sourcing to manage the content. <br>

- **Example 1**: Product A and Product B follow the same safety guidelines. You write a safety guide once and insert it into the product manuals of both products. 
- **Example 2**: You write an introcution for a new product. The techncial writing team includes the product introduction in the help manual and the marketing team uses the same introduction in the marketing brochures. 

## Benefits of using single-sourcing    
Single-sourcing offers the following benefits: <br>

- **Efficiency**. For shared content, you only need to create it once and then you can reuse it often. This saves time and reduces redundancy. <br>
- **Consistency**. When there's update to the content, you only need to make the update in a single place and the update is reflected in all places where the content is used. This ensures content consistency across outputs and channels.<br>
- **Scalbility**. When information needs expand, single-sourcing allows easy scaling. For example, if your product manual used to be published in PDFs only and now you also need to make it available online. Single-sourcing makes it easy to adapt without creating duplicate content.
