### Snippets
Use snippets to create small chunks of reusable content, such as paragraphs, tables, and images. When using snippets, the formating of the content is preserved.<br>
For example, if commands A and B share the same set of parameters, you can create a snippet containing a table that describes those parameters. Then in each individual topic that exaplains the two commands, you can insert the snippet.   
### Single project, different outputs
When large volumes of content can be shared, you can set up one Flare project and generate various outputs. Typical use cases of this are: <br>
- On-premises and SaaS versions of the same product. 
- A same help guide published online and in PDFs. <br>

To use a single Flare project to generate various outputs, do the following:<br>
1. Create a Flare poject and create all the topics.
2. Set up a TOC for each output.
3. Set up a target for each ouput.
4. 

When large volumes of content can be shared, you can set up one Flare project and generate various outputs. Typical use cases of this are: <br>

### At paragraph level
Use snippets to single source small chunks of reusable content, such as paragraphs, tables, and images. When using snippets, the formating of the content is preserved. For example, if commands A and B share the same set of parameters, you can create a snippet containing a table that describes those parameters. Then you insert the snippet in each respective topic that describes the two commands.   
### At topic level
When larger pieces of content can be shared, you can single source and reuse the content at the topic level. For instance, you create a topic introducing a product and then use this topic in the product's user guide and administration guide. If some sentences or paragraphs in the topic require different content for different guides (such as a feature only available to admins), you can use conditional text in the relevant sentence or paragraph.  
### At output level
When large volumes of content (like most content in a guide) can be shared, you can set up one Flare project and generate various outputs. Typical use cases of this are: <br>
- On-premises and SaaS versions of the same product. 
- A same help guide published online and in PDFs. <br>

To use a single Flare project to generate various outputs, do the following:<br>
1. Set up a TOC for each output.
3. Set up a target for each ouput.
4. For topics that require different content for each output, you can use conditional content or snippets. For details, see [At paragraph level](#at-paragraph-level) and [At topic level](#at-topic-level).
