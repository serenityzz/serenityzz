GitBook published the¬†**[State of Docs Report 2025](https://www.stateofdocs.com/2025/)** in May 2025. This topic summarizes some of the highlights of the report. <br>

## AI and the future of the documentation

According to the report, 60% of respondents are currently using generative AI as part of their docs workflows. Most teams mainly use AI for content generation (41.5%) and editing (28.5%). When AI is making a difference for many teams, it‚Äôs clear that human oversight is still essential to keep docs accurate, clear, and useful.

- **AI can speed up documentation work but will not replace technical writers.** Use AI to handle repetitive tasks, while writers focus on strategy, quality, and complex content. Writers shift from writing conent to reviewing and editing AI-generated content, organizing and structuring information, and thinking strategically about how users find and use content.

- **Docs shift from static pages to interactive conversations.** Many companies are alreay thinking of docs as interatvie converstations. Users ask questions, and get the right answers, rather than looking through pages of user manuals. <br>
  
  The future of docs isn‚Äôt just about writing pages ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating systems where users can interact, explore, and get exactly the help they need, when they need it.

- **Users expect answers appear exactly when they need them.** The future of documentation is less about expecting users to come find answers ‚Äî and more about making sure the answers find them. In the future the documentation focus should be to build help directly into the product experience to help users find answers faster and personalize the docs experience based on what each individual user needs. 

- **Clear, well-structured documentaiton is the foundation for successful AI.** The success of AI relies highly on clear, well-structured human-created documentation. So teams need to focus on getting the basics right ‚Äî clear writing, good structure, and up-to-date content ‚Äî before leaning too hard on AI tools.
