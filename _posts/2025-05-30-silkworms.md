This spring, I raised silkworms for the very first time. :blossom: <br>

I grew up in the Yangtze River Delta, where it is common to raise silkworms to produce silk; and in spring, mulberry leaves, the only food silkworms eat, are plentiful. :leaves: <br>
Still, never in my life have I raised any myself. I avoided it because I don’t like insects, especially the soft-bodied kind without a spine. Just thinking about them crawling would make me feel uneasy. :worried:

The idea to raise silkworms came from my daughter’s Nature class at school. <br>
One evening during dinner, she said, *“Mum, our Nature teacher is giving us silkworm eggs to hatch at home. Can I bring some back so we can watch how they become silkworms, grow through different stages, and eventually become moths?”* :blush:

I wanted to say no. But trying to be a supportive mother, I gave a reluctant yet encouraging nod. <br>
*“Sure, if you want to. But you’ll have to take responsibility for taking care of them.”*

The next day, she came home with them, in a small box she had folded from a piece of paper. Inside were tiny black specks, barely visible.<br>
*“Where are your silkworms?”* I asked. :confused: <br>
*“They’re in there,”* she replied, pointing to the box. :point_right: <br>
I looked inside. :dizzy_face: *“There’s nothing here.”* <br>
*“See those black dots? Those are the eggs. They’ll hatch in a few days.”* <br>
The eggs were so small, like dirt. If I hadn’t known it, I might have wiped them away.

Over the course of a week, those black dots turned grey, and then became little black lines about two millimeters long. Each day, they grew noticeably bigger. After another week, they became white silkworms 🐛 and grew fatter and fatter.  

Every day after work, I would spend some time just watching them eat mulberry leaves. <br>
They were completely absorbed in their task. In less than a minute, they could chew a hole the size of their bodies. If you leaned in close enough, you could even hear them munching, a sound like soft raindrops falling on leaves during a spring night🌧️. <br>

That quiet moment brought me great comfort during a tough time, when the company I had worked at for years had just announced that it would close all positions in the city where I live, and the job market was extremely rough.

As I watched the silkworms eat with such focus as if nothing else existed in the world but eating, I kept wondering: how can they be so focused? Is it because eating is the only thing they can do? Or is it because they firmly believe that if they just keep eating, they will grow?

I don’t know the answer.<br>
But perhaps, just like them, the only thing I can do is to keep going, and for me, that is, to keep writing. ✍️
